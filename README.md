chat_front.py It contains the frontend programming which displays the human-bot interaction page where he can write the query and bot will provide the answer by finding the match from the data provided in chat_back.py. Moreover, in case any query is not available in the database, it asks for user’s email-id for future update in this chatbot’s database.
